	Private Sector Bust: By - Shooting Shark : 
	The following article appeared in the August, 1985

	     On July 12, 1985, law enforcement officials seized the Private
	Sector BBS, the official computer bulletin board of 2600 magazine,
	for "complicity in computer theft," under the newly passed, and yet
	untested, New Jersey Statute 2C:20-25.  Police had uncovered in	
	April a credit carding ring operated around a Middlesex County
	electronic bulletin board, and from  there investigated other North
	Jersey bulletin boards.  Not understanding subject matter of the
	Private Sector BBS, police assumed that the sysop was  involved in	
	illegal activities.  Six other computers were also seized in this
	investigation, including those of Store Manager [perhaps they mean
	Swap Shop Manager? - Shark] who ran a BBS of his own, Beowolf, Red
	Barchetta, the Vampire, NJ Hack Shack, sysop of the NJ Hack Shack
	BBS, and that of the sysop of the Treasure Chest BBS. Immediately
	after this action, members of 2600 contacted the media, who were
	completely unaware of any of the raids.  They began to bombard the	
	Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office with questions and a press
	conference  was announced for July 16.  The system operator of the
	Private Sector BBS attempted to attend along with reporters from
	2600.  They were effectively  thrown off the premises.  Threats
	were made to charge them with trespassing and other crimes.  An
	officer who had at first received them civilly was  threatened with
	the loss of his job if he didn't get them removed promptly.  Then
	the car was chased out of the parking lot.  Perhaps prosecutor Alan
	Rockoff was afraid that he presence of some technically literate
	reporters would ruin the effect of his press release on the public.
	As it happens, he didn't need our help. The next day the details of
	the press conference were reported to the public by the press.  As
	Rockoff intended, paranoia about hackers ran rampant. Headlines got
	as ridiculous as hackers ordering tank parts by telephone from TRW 
	and moving satellites with their home computers in order to make 
	free phone calls.  These and even more exotic stories were reported 
	by otherwise respectable media sources. The news conference  
	understandably made the front page of most of the major newspapers 
	in the US, and was a major news item as far away as Australia and in 
	the United Kingdom due to the sensationalism of the claims.  We will 
	try to explain why these claims may have been made in this issue. On 
	July 18 the operator of The Private Sector was formally charged with
	"computer conspiracy" under the above law, and released in the 
	custody of his parents.  The next day the American Civil Liberties 
	Union took over his defense.  The ACLU commented that it would be 
	very hard for Rockoff to prove a conspiracy just "because the same 
	information, construed by the prosecutor to be illegal, appears on 
	two bulletin boards." especially as Rockoff admitted that "he did 
	not believe any of the defendants knew each other."  The ACLU believes 
	that the system operator's rights were violated, as he was assumed 
	to be involved in an illegal activity just because of other people 

                                  - 70 -


	under investigation who happened to have posted messages on his
	board. In another statement which seems to confirm Rockoff's belief
	in guilt by association, he announced the  next day that "630
	people were being investigated to determine if any used their
	computer equipment fraudulently."  We believe this is only the user
	list of the NJ Hack Shack, so the actual list of those to be
	investigated may turn out to be almost 5 times that.  The sheer
	overwhelming difficulty of this task may kill this investigation,
	especially as they find that many hackers simply leave false
	information.  Computer hobbyists all across the country have 
	already been called by the Bound Brook, New Jersey 	office of the 
	FBI.  They reported that the FBI agents used scare 	tactics in order 
	to force confessions or to provoke them into turning in others.  We 
	would like to remind those who get called that there is nothing 
	inherently wrong or illegal in calling any ANY BBS, nor in talking 
	about ANY activity.  The FBI would not comment on the case as it is 
	an "ongoing investigation" and in the hands of the local prosecutor.  
	They will soon find that many on the Private Sector BBS's user list 
	are data processing managers, telecommunications security people, 
	and others who are interested in the subject of the BBS, hardly the 
	underground community of computer criminals depicted at the news 
	conference.  The Private Sector BBS was a completely open BBS, and 
	police and security people were even invited on in order to participate.
	The BBS was far from  the "elite" type of underground telecom boards
	that Rockoff attempted to portray. Within two days, Rockoff took
	back almost all of the statements he had made at the news
	conference, as AT&T and the DoD [Department of Defense - Shark]
	discounted the claims he had made.  He was understandably unable to
	find real proof of Private Sector's alleged illegal activity, and
	was faced with having to return the computer equipment with nothing
	to show for his effort. Rockoff panicked, and on July 31, the
	system operator had a new charge against him, "wiring up his
	computer as a blue box."  Apparently this was referring to his
	Novation Applecat modem which is capable of generating any hertz
	tone over the phone line.  By this stretch of imagination an
	Applecat could produce a 2600 hertz tone as well as the MF which is
	necessary for "blue boxing." However, each and every other owner of
	an Applecat or any other modem that can generate its own tones
	therefore has also "wired up his computer as a blue box" by merely
	installing the modem. This charge is so ridiculous that Rockoff
	probably will never bother to press it.  However, the wording of
	WIRING UP THE COMPUTER gives rockoff an excuse to continue to hold
	onto the computer longer in his futile search for illegal activity.
	"We have requested that the prosecutors give us more specific
	information," said Arthur Miller, the lawyer for The Private
	Sector. "The charges are so vague that we can't really present a
	case at this point." Miller will appear in court on August 16 to
	obtain this information.  He is also issuing a demand for the
	return of the equipment and, if the prosecutors don't cooperate,
	will commence court proceedings against them.  "They haven't
	been particularly cooperative," he said. 

                                  - 71 -
 
		Rockoff probably will soon reconsider taking Private Sector's
	case to court, as he will have to admit he just didn't know what he
	was doing when he seized the BBS.  The arrest warrant listed only
	"computer conspiracy" against Private Sector, which is much more
	difficult to prosecute than the multitude of charges against some 
	of the other defendants, which include credit card fraud, toll 
	fraud, the unauthorized entry into computers, and numerous others. 
	Both Rockoff and the ACLU mentioned the Supreme Court in their 
	press releases, but he will assuredly take one of his stronger 
	cases to test the new New Jersey computer crime law.  by seizing 
	the BBS just because of supposed activities discussed on it, 
	Rockoff raises constitutional questions.  Darrell Paster, a 
	lawyer who centers much of his work on computer crime, says 
	the New Jersey case is "just another example of local law 
	enforcement getting on the bandwagon of crime that has come into 
	vogue to prosecute, and they have proceeded with very little 
	technical understanding, and in the process they have abused many 
	people's constitutional rights.  What we have developing is a mini 
	witch hunt which is analogous to some of the arrests at day care 
	centers, where they sweep in and arrest everybody, ruin reputations, 
	and then find that there is only one or two guilty parties."  We feel 
	that law enforcement, not understanding the information on the BBS,
	decided to strike first and ask  questions later. 2600 magazine and
	the sysops of the Private Sector BBS stand fully behind the system
	operator.  As soon as the equipment is returned, the BBS will go
	back up.  We ask all our readers to do their utmost to support us
	in our efforts, and to educate as many of the public as possible
	that a hacker is not a computer criminal.  We are all
	convinced of our sysop's innocence, and await Rockoff's dropping of
	the charges. 

	NOTE:  Readers will notice that our reporting of the events are
	quite different than those presented in the media and by the
	Middlesex County Prosecutor.  We can only remind you that we are
	much closer to the events at hand than the media is, and that we
	are much more technologically literate than the Middlesex County
	Prosecutor's Office.  The Middlesex County Prosecutor has already
	taken back many of his statements, after the contentions were
	disproven by AT&T and the DoD.  One problem is that the media and
	the police tend to treat the seven cases as one case, thus the
	charges against and activities of some of the hackers has been

	Phreaking AT&T Cards: By - Net Runner

	    My topic will deal with using an AT&T calling card for
	automated calls. Ok to place a call with an AT&T card, lift the
	handset (PAY PHONE) hit (0) and the desired area code and the 
	number to call. Also when calling the same number that the card is
	being billed to you enter the phone number and at  the tone only
	enter the last four digits on the card. But we don't want  to do
	that now, do we. If additional calls are wanted all you do is hit
	the (#) and you will get a new dial tone! After you hit (#) you do
	not have to  re-enter the calling card number  simply enter your
	desired number and it will connect you. If the number you called is
	busy just keep hitting (#) and the number to be called until you
	connect! Ok to calL the U.S. of a from another country, you use the
	exact same format as described above! Ok now I will describe the
	procedure for placing calls to a foreign country, such as
	CANADA,RUSSIA,SOUTH AMERICA, etc.. Ok first lift the handset then
	enter (01) + the country code + the city code + the local telephone
	number. Ok after you get the tone enter the AT&T calling card
	number. Ok if you can not dial operator assisted calls from your
	area don't worry just jingle the operator and she will handle your
	call, don't worry she can't see you! The international number on
	the AT&T calling card is used for calling the US of A from places
	like RUSSIA, CHINA you never know when you might get stuck in a
	country like those and you have no money to make a call! The
	international operator will be able to tell you if they honor the
	AT&T calling card. Well I hope that this has straightened out some
	of your problems on the use of an AT&T calling card! All you have
	to remember is that weather you are placing the call or the
	operator, be careful and never use the calling card from your home
	phone!! That is a BIG NO NO.. Also AT&T has came out with a new
	thing called (NEW CARD CALLER SERVICE) they say that it was
	designed to meet the public's needs! These phones will be popping
	up in many place such as airport terminals, hotels, etc... What the
	new card caller service is, is a new type of phone that has a 
	(CRT) screen that will talk to you in a language of your choice.
	The  service works something like this, when you find a (NEW CARD
	CALLER PHONE), all you do is follow the instructions on the (CRT)
	screen, then you insert the (NEW CARD CALLER CARD) and there is a
	strip of magnetic tape on the card  which reads the number, thus no
	one can hear you saying your number or if there were a bug in the
	phone,no touch tones will be heard!! You can also bill the call to
	a third party. that is  one that I am not totally clear on yet! The
	phone is supposed to tell you how it can be done. That is after you 
	have inserted your card and lifted the receiver!

BASIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS: By - < Net Runner >

	CN/A:

    	CN/A, WHICH STANDS FOR CUSTOMER NAME AND ADDRESS, ARE BUREAUS
	THAT EXIST SO THAT AUTHORIZED BELL EMPLOYEES CAN FIND OUT THE NAME
	AND ADDRESS OF ANY CUSTOMER IN THE BELL SYSTEM.  ALL #'S ARE
	MAINTAINED ON FILE INCLUDING UNLISTED #'S.

	HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:

	1) YOU HAVE A # AND YOU WANT TO FIND OUT WHO OWNS IT, E.G. (914)
	555-1234.

	2) YOU LOOK UP THE CN/A # FOR THAT NPA IN THE LIST BELOW.  IN THE
	EXAMPLE, THE NPA IS 914 AND THE CN/A# IS 518-471-8111.

	3) YOU THEN CALL UP THE CN/A # (DURING BUSINESS HOURS) AND SAY
	SOMETHING LIKE, "HI, THIS IS JOHN JONES FROM THE RESIDENTIAL
	SERVICE CENTER IN MIAMI. CAN I HAVE THE CUSTOMER'S NAME AT
	914-555-1234.  THAT # IS 914-555-1234." MAKE UP YOUR OWN REAL
	SOUNDING NAME, THOUGH.

	4) IF YOU SOUND NATURAL & CHEERY, THE OPERATOR WILL ASK NO
	QUESTIONS.

	A little something about Your phone company: By Col. Hogan        

    	 Ever get an operator who gave you a hard time, and you didn't
	know what to do? Well if the operator hears you use a little Bell
	jargon, she might wise up. Here is a little diagram (excuse the
	artwork) of the structure of operators

	/--------\     /------\     /-----\   /-------------\

	!Operator!-- > ! S.A. ! --->! BOS !   ! Group Cheif !

	\--------/     \------/     \-----/   \-------------/

	    Now most of the operators are not bugged, so they can curse at
	you, if they do ask INSTANTLY for the "S.A." or the Service
	Assistant. The operator does not report to her (95% of them are
	hers) but they will solve most of your problems. She MUST give you
	her name as she connects & all of these calls are bugged. If the SA
	gives you a rough time get her BOS (Business Office Supervisor) on
	the line. S/He will almost always back her girls up, but sometimes
	the SA will get tarred and feathered. The operator reports to the
	Group Chief, and S/He will solve 100% of your problems, but the
	chances of getting S/He on the line are nill. If a lineman (the guy
	who works out on the poles) or an Installation man gives you the
	works ask to speak to the Instal- lation Foreman, that works
	wonders. Here is some other bell Jar- gon, that might come in handy
	if you are having trouble with the line. Or they can be used to lie
	your way out of situations. An Erling is a line busy for 1 hour,
	used mostly in traffic studies A Permanent Signal is that terrible
	howling you get if you disc- connect, but don't hang up. Everyone
	knows what a busy signal is, but some idiots think that is the
	*Actual* ringing of the phone, when it just is a tone "beeps" when
	the phone is ringing, woul- ldn't bet on this though, it can (and
	does) get out of sync. When you get a busy signal that is 2 times
	as fast as the normal one, the person you are trying to reach isn't
	really on the phone, (he might be), it is actually the signal that
	a trunk line somewhere is busy and they haven't or can't reroute
	your call. Sometimes you will get a Recording, or if you get
	nothing at all (Left High & Dry in fone terms) all the recordings
	are being used and the system is really overused, will probably go
	down in a little while. This happened when Kennedy was shot, the
	system just couldn't handle the calls. By the way this is called
	the "reorder signal" and the trunk line is "blocked". One more
	thing, if an overseas call isn't completed and doesn't generate any
	money for AT&T, is is called an "Air & Water Call".

	     This is a file I just decided to write, right after a guy that
	lives near me, who runs a bbs complained about his outrageously
	high phone bill, and being that I use 0266's I decided that I would
	TRY to write a text file on how to use the 0266's as a simple way
	of phreaking. I am not an expert on the subject and I don't claim
	to be, I am just writing this file to try to help out others that
	are in the same experiance level as the guy that I was talking
	about previouly in the file.

	     There are many different types of 950's, but the type I use is
	the 950-0266 and I use these because that is what I was taught with
	and they seem like a fairly good, and easy way to phreak. 950-0266s
	are known to have VERY clean lines, so they are perfect to use with
	modems.

	         The basic format for these codes are:

	     (1)  Dial 950-0266
	     (2)  Wait for tone then dial your 7 digit Code
	     (3)  Right after dialing your Code dial your ACN (Area Code
	          Number)

	      I.E. if I were to call my friend Joe in Utah, I would do
	      this... 950-0266 (tone) XXXXXXX8015551234 The X's stand for 
	      the 7 digit code

	     950's have known to be dangerouse, they are on ESS (electronic
	switching service) which is a phreaks nightmare. Being that 950's
	are on the ESS they can, and have been known to trace. The type of
	tracing service on 950's can trace in a heart beat, so there is
	somewhat a great risk in using these. Some precautions about using
	950s - Do NOT use the same code for more then 3 days. Try to use
	different codes if you have them i.e. call one board with a code
	like 2314211 , and then call the next board with a totally
	different code. Use these codes during prime time, to cut the risk
	of getting caught down. And use these in moderation, do not get
	crazy with them.

	     I hope this file hasnt been to much of a waste of time, I hope
	it has offered some help to you in using 950-0266's. I would like
	to have suggestions and comments on what you think of my file.  If
	you have valid Input, please let me know your opinion on
	Al.P.H.A.'s home Board (801)!!!

	Code Hacking falls into both the hacking and phreaking category.
	Think about it. You have to HACK in order to get codez and then you
	PHREAK when you get the codez. I'm not going to go into great
	detail on code phreaking, this text file is going to deal mainly
	with "CODE HACKING". I get asked all the time where and how to get
	codez. I'm hoping this file will clear up this question for a lot
	of people. This is not my first  text file, but I don't make a
	habbit out of them yet!


	   Code Hacking, What is it:
	   -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
       Simply enough it's where you get a dial up (IE. 1-800's or
	950's) and set up a code hacking program and config it to the code
	you're about to hack and let it run. Now there are hundrends of
	dial ups for us pkreakers/hackers to play with (I will list a few
	at the end of this phile), and the code lenght and formats also
	very a great deal. Now you can get your hacker set up and let it
	run all night and if Gh0d's willing you might get lucky
	and get a code by the next day. 

	     Ok the best way to go about Code hacking is to get a format or
	template if you perfer to call it that. Now they look like this.
	801XX, where you know the first 3 digits of the code is 801, but
	the last 2 digits are unknown and you have to hack out the  last 2
	digits. If you know all but 2 digits then you have a 1 in 100 shot
	in getting a code each time your hacker trys to  hack a code, of
	course the longer the code or the less digits you know the less
	chance you have in hacking a code. But belive me
	it's never a lost cause. You can have zero digits and still get
	codez.

	A Lesson in Formats #1:

	     Ok say your going to hack 1-800-635-9135, Code lenght is 5
	digits, and already have the following codez!
                                  22199
